### Summary

At the start of 2024, I was invited by SAP to co-author a chapter for an academic publication on Human-Centered AI. Our chapter, written in collaboration with Shilpa Tripathi Jurinek, explores the interplay between creativity and generative AI, and how the AI-human dynamic is evolving in creative industries.

**Key achievements:**

- Published a peer-reviewed chapter in a major Springer academic book
- Explored best practices for integrating generative AI into creative workflows
- Provided critical perspectives on maintaining human-centered design in the age of AI
- Collaborated with international experts from SAP and the academic community

### Impact

This work contributes to the global conversation on responsible and human-centered AI, offering actionable insights for designers, researchers, and technologists. The chapter is part of a broader effort to bridge the gap between technology and human creativity, ensuring that innovation enhances rather than replaces the creative process.
