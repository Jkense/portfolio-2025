## The Leapfrog Research Workflow

Leapfrog guides you through every step of qualitative research, from raw interviews to actionable insights:

### 1. Interview

Conduct and record user interviews or research sessions to collect qualitative data (audio or video).

### 2. Transcribing

Upload your recordings to Leapfrog. The platform transcribes audio and video into text, supports multiple languages, and offers options for redaction and filler word removal.

### 3. Coding

Use intuitive coding tools to tag and categorize key themes, concepts, and patterns in your transcripts. Coding helps organize complex conversations into manageable insights.

### 4. Canvas: Visual Synthesis

Move coded data onto the Canvas for visual mapping and clustering. Organize quotes, notes, and themes. Use AI-powered clustering to group related data points and visually explore relationships.
