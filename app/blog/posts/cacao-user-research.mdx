[CACAO](https://www.cacao.care/) is an open platform designed to strengthen networked care by bringing together professional and social networks around the client or patient. My involvement in this project began at an early stage, focusing on uncovering user needs and opportunities for improvement in the mental healthcare space.

## My Role: User Researcher & UX Designer

As a user researcher, I conducted interviews with both caregivers and clients, aiming to understand their daily workflows, pain points, and aspirations. These insights were crucial in shaping the direction of CACAO, ensuring the platform truly addressed the needs of its diverse user base.

In addition to research, I was actively involved in the UX design process. Working closely with the design team, we translated research findings into actionable design solutions, iterating on wireframes and prototypes. Our workflow was highly collaborative and iterative, with design and development activities running in parallel. This allowed us to continuously improve the product based on real user feedback and technical feasibility.

## What Made This Project Unique

- **Iterative Workflow:** We adopted a sprint-based approach, enabling rapid prototyping, testing, and refinement. This ensured that improvements were made continuously, not just at the end of a development cycle.
- **Parallel Dev & Design:** Designers and developers worked side by side, allowing for quick handovers and immediate feedback loops.
- **Focus on Real Needs:** By interviewing both caregivers and clients, we ensured that CACAO's features—like secure chat, video calls, and 360-degree client views—were grounded in real-world needs and workflows.

## Impact & Learnings

The iterative, user-centered approach led to a platform that is not only technically robust but also genuinely useful for its users. The experience reinforced the value of early and ongoing user research, as well as the power of close collaboration between design and development teams.
